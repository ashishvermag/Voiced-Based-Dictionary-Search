# Voice-Based Dictionary Search Using Speech Commands

## Abstract
This project aims to develop a **speech recognition system** that can recognize spoken words in real time. Our system functions as a **voice-based dictionary search**, allowing users to instantly view the meaning of any spoken word. The system helps users quickly understand and verify definitions of words through voice commands.

It is trained using **pre-recorded audio datasets** containing pronunciations of dictionary words, enabling it to recognize words accurately even with different accents and dialects. The recognition process uses **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** to create acoustic models for each word and identify them during real-time testing. The application is developed using **C/C++ programming language** in the **Visual Studio IDE**. Currently, the system supports a limited number of dictionary words; however, it can easily be extended to include more words in future updates.

## Experimental Setup
The basic requirements for this project are as follows:

- **Windows Operating System**
- **Microsoft Visual Studio 2010**
- **C++11 integrated with Microsoft Visual Studio (VS) 2010**
- **Recording Module** (for capturing and preparing pre-recorded training data)

## Conclusion
This project introduces a **voice-based dictionary search system** that recognizes spoken words instantly and displays their meanings clearly on the screen. By utilizing **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)**, we have achieved reliable recognition of dictionary words, even with variations in pronunciation and accents.

Although the current implementation supports only a limited vocabulary, future enhancements can easily expand the number of recognized words and improve overall accuracy and performance. Additionally, there is potential for integrating this system into various educational tools and applications to enhance user interaction and learning experiences.
